# dbms-project
This repository contains a SQL project for a fictional electronics retail store named JigiBoxZ which is purely fictional. It was developed as a group project. The project includes the complete database schema, sample data, and a series of complex queries designed to answer various business questions and case studies. The database is designed to handle customer information, staff, vendors, product inventory, sales transactions, and purchase transactions.

Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
This project showcases a wide range of SQL skills, including:

Database Design: Logical schema design with multiple tables and relationships.
Data Integrity: Use of PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, and NOT NULL constraints.
Data Definition Language (DDL): CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW.
Data Manipulation Language (DML): INSERT statements to populate the database with realistic sample data.

Core Concepts & Features
- **Database Schema & Design**
  - Detailed schema with 9 normalized tables (Customers, Products, Sales, Purchases, etc.).
  - Enforced data integrity using `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and `CHECK` constraints.
- **Complex Transactional Queries**
  - Solved 10+ business case studies using advanced `JOIN`s, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
  - Performed complex filtering and grouping with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.
- **Data Manipulation & Views**
  - Populated database with realistic sample data using `INSERT` statements.
  - Created `VIEW`s to encapsulate and simplify access to complex data summaries.
- **Advanced T-SQL Functions**
  - Extensive use of String (`REPLACE`, `CONCAT`), Date (`YEAR`, `FORMAT`), and Conditional (`CASE`) functions.

Tech Stack
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
- **Language**: SQL
- **Core Skills**: Database Design, DDL, DML, DQL
- **Paradigm**: Relational Database Management
